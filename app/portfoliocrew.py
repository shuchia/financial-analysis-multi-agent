                             REQUIREMENTS:
            1. Suggest specific ETFs (stock, bond, international) and/or individual stocks with exact percentages
            2. Match the risk tolerance (don't exceed it) and include appropriate bond allocation:
               - Conservative: 40-60% bonds (BND, AGG, VGIT, TLT) for stability
               - Moderate: 20-40% bonds for balanced risk/return
               - Aggressive: 0-20% bonds (optional - can focus on growth)
            3. Adjust allocation based on timeline:
               - Short timeline (1-2 years): Increase bond allocation by 10-20% for capital preservation
               - Long timeline (10+ years): Can reduce bonds for growth focus
            4. Include international diversification: 15-30% in international ETFs (VXUS, VEU, VWO)
            5. For {amount_display}, suggest {get_position_count(amount_numeric)} positions maximum
            6. Include dollar amounts for each holding
            7. Provide brief reasoning for each pick
            8. Use only ETFs and stocks available for fractional shares
            9. Minimize fees - prioritize low-cost index funds
            10. Consider tax efficiency if applicable
            11. Ensure proper diversification across asset classes
            12. Address the investor directly as 'you/your' (never 'the investor/their')

            OUTPUT FORMAT:
            CRITICAL: You MUST provide each holding in this EXACT format on a single line:
            TICKER (Category) - XX% ($X,XXX) - Brief reasoning why this benefits you

            REQUIRED COMPONENTS FOR EACH HOLDING:
            1. TICKER symbol (2-5 letters)
            2. (Category) in parentheses immediately after ticker
            3. Percentage with % symbol
            4. Dollar amount in parentheses with $ symbol
            5. Dash followed by reasoning (one clear sentence about the benefit to this investor)

            EXAMPLES:
            VTI (Stock ETF) - 40% ($4,000) - Provides you with broad US market exposure for core growth
            BND (Bond ETF) - 30% ($3,000) - Gives you stability and income for your {user_profile.get('risk_profile', 'moderate')} profile
            VXUS (International ETF) - 20% ($2,000) - Diversifies you globally beyond US markets
            AAPL (Technology) - 10% ($1,000) - Adds targeted tech sector growth potential

            Categories should be one of: Stock ETF, Bond ETF, International ETF, REIT ETF, Dividend ETF, Technology, Healthcare, Financial, Consumer, Energy, Industrial, Real Estate, Growth, Value

            ## PERFORMANCE OUTLOOK
            Expected Annual Return: X-Y%

            Key Monitoring Points:
            - Rebalancing trigger: [Specify when to rebalance, e.g., "When any position drifts more than 5% from target allocation"]
            - Monitoring frequency: [Based on their timeline, e.g., "Quarterly review recommended for 5-10 year timeline"]
            - Volatility expectations: [Expected volatility range, e.g., "Moderate volatility (10-15% annual standard deviation)"]

            ## COST EFFICIENCY
            - [Specific expense ratios of the funds you chose, e.g., "VTI expense ratio: 0.03% - among the lowest available"]
            - [Tax efficiency considerations specific to these holdings, e.g., "ETF structure provides tax-efficient capital gains distribution"]

        Explain this OPTIMIZED portfolio allocation to the investor:

        OPTIMIZED ALLOCATION (from Modern Portfolio Theory optimization):
        {allocation_details}

        OPTIMIZATION METRICS:
        {opt_metrics_text}

        USER PROFILE:
        - Age: {user_profile.get('age_range', '25-35')}
        - Risk Tolerance: {user_profile.get('risk_profile', 'moderate')}
        - Timeline: {user_profile.get('timeline', '5-10 years')}
        - Goal: {user_profile.get('primary_goal', 'wealth_building')}

        YOUR TASK:
        Explain this optimized portfolio using the SAME format as original portfolio creation.
        Address the investor directly as 'you/your'.

        OUTPUT FORMAT (CRITICAL - EXACT MATCH REQUIRED):
        For each holding, provide in this EXACT format:
        TICKER (Category) - XX% ($X,XXX) - Brief reasoning why this optimized allocation benefits you

        Categories should be: Stock ETF, Bond ETF, International ETF, REIT ETF, Dividend ETF, Technology, Healthcare, Financial, Consumer, Energy, Industrial, Real Estate, Growth, Value

        Then provide these sections with exact headers:

        ## RISK MANAGEMENT
        Key Risks to Watch:
        - [3-5 specific risks based on THIS optimized portfolio's composition]
        - [Focus on concentration risks, sector exposures, correlation issues specific to these holdings]

        ## PERFORMANCE OUTLOOK
        Expected Annual Return: {opt_return*100-1:.0f}-{opt_return*100+1:.0f}%

        Key Monitoring Points:
        - Rebalancing trigger: [When to rebalance, e.g., "When any position drifts more than 5%"]
        - Monitoring frequency: [Based on timeline, e.g., "Quarterly review"]
        - Volatility expectations: [Expected volatility, e.g., "Moderate volatility (10-15% annual)"]

        ## COST EFFICIENCY
        - [Actual expense ratios of the funds you chose]
        - [Tax efficiency considerations for these specific holdings]
        - [Fee minimization achieved through optimization]

        REMEMBER: You are EXPLAINING why optimization chose these allocations, not creating new ones.
